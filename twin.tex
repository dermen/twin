\section{Introduction}

Solution correlated x-ray scattering (SCXS) is an emerging field which involves recording many snapshot exposures of a solution, and employing photon intensity correlation analysis in order to recover a function dependent only on the average internal structure of the objects in solution phase [1]. SCXS has potential to reveal the structural properties of proteins without the use of crystalization or single protein imaging. An obvious precursor to the study of soft matter SCXS is that of nanoparticles (NPs), due to their typically large scattering cross sections. NP solutions are used in chemical catalysis, and the overall shape and atomic structure of the NPs are directly related to their chemical properties [2,3]. As such, there is great need for additional characterization methods. Great work has been done describing the thermodynamics and kinetics of NP growth and formation [4,5]. It is known that smaller NPs (tens of nanometers) tend to form complicated twinning structures, e.g. icosahedral twins [6,7,8]. Previously, twinning has been observed using electron microscopy and tomography [9,10], where one images single NP projections. On the other hand, conventional powder x-ray diffraction measurements, used widely in industry to characterize ensembles of NPs, are isotropic averages and don't show signs of twinning (figure 1).
 
\section{Theory}
If the x-ray source is bright enough, then an exposed object can scatter photons into at least two directions, $\bm q_1$ and $\bm q_2$. While the orientation of this object is random, the angle $\,\, \cos (\psi) = (\bm q_1 \cdot \bm q_2)/(q_1 \, q_2 )\,\,$ is not; it is constrained by the objects internal atomic structure. A crystalline NP scatters photons into discrete vectors $\bm g_{hkl}$. Let a detector be a set of pixels $\{\bm q\}$. Then an NP at orientation $\omega$ can scatter into the detector provided 

\be \label{condition}
\hat{\bm R}_\omega \cdot \bm g_{hkl} \in \{\bm q\}
\ee

where $\hat{\bm R}_\omega$ is a rotation operator. During each exposure of the solution, we assume a small fraction of NPs in solution are oriented such that condition (\ref{condition}) is met for two scattering directions, $\bm g_{hkl}$ and $\bm g_{h'k'l'}$. This double Bragg scattering produces angular intensity correlations between pixels whose angular separation corresponds to the interplanar angles between sets of crystallographic planes $hkl$ and $h'k'l'$. For example, the $\{111\}$ family of planes for face-centered-cubic NPs will produce angular correlations at

\be \label{g1}
\frac{\bm g_{111} \cdot \bm g_{11\bar{1}}}{|\bm g_{111}| |\bm g_{11\bar{1}}| } = \frac{1}{3}
\ee

and

\be \label {g2}
\frac{\bm g_{111} \cdot \bm g_{\bar{1}\bar{1}1}}{|\bm g_{111}| |\bm g_{\bar{1}\bar{1}1}| } = -\frac{1}{3}
\ee

in the $(111)$ Bragg ring (See figure 1A ). Note that these are supplementary angles, which is a direct consequence of Friedel symmetry [11] between $g_{11\bar{1}}$ and $g_{\bar{1}\bar{1}1}$.
%x-ray angular correlations, Bragg peak correlations, silver nanoparticles, atomic %resolution x-ray scattering, synchrotron radiation, solution ensemble
In a typical exposure, most NPs will not scatter into the detector, and the ones that do will not be oriented such that they scatter into multiple detectable directions. Therefore, the average exposure is comprised of a large fraction of randomly scattered photons (owing to the orientation randomness in  a solution). As such, the signal-to-noise is much less than unity for a single exposure, and scales as the square root of the number of averaged exposures, $N_s$ [12]. We consider an exposure to be a snapshot, meaning the NPs should not be moving significantly throughout the exposure duration. This is accomplished automatically with the femtosecond timescale pulses of the SACLA facility [13]. However, SCXS can be conducted at synchrotron facilities, provided  that the sample is prepared accordingly, and that it is cooled during exposure [14,15]. The $\{111\}$ planes scatter photons into a Bragg ring of constant magnitude $q_{111}$, forming a ring of pixels $I(q_{111},\phi)$ on a planar detector. In order to realize the correlations (\ref{g1}, \ref{g2}), one calculates the mean auto-correlation of $\{111\}$ Bragg rings over exposures $s$

\be
C(q_{111}, q_{111}, \Delta) = \sum _s ^ {N_s} \int _0^{2\pi} I_s(q_{111}, \phi  )\, I_s(q_{111}, \phi + \Delta)\, d\phi
\ee

and projects [ref] this correlation onto the Ewald sphere using the relationship

\be
\cos( \psi) = cos( \Delta ) \, \cos ^2 ( \theta_{111} )  + \sin ^2(\theta_{111} )  
\ee

where $\theta_{111}$ is the scattering angle at wavelength $\lambda$

\be
q_{111} = \frac{ 4\pi }{\lambda } \sin (\theta_{111})  
\ee


\section{Experimental}
60 nanometer Gold NPs were purchased from Nanopartz Inc. [ref] and suspended in LCP at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. The viscous solution was injected into the beam as a constant stream using a  hamilton 7780 syringe needle with inner diameter 130 $\mu m$.

The SACLA beam was focused down to a roughly $25 âˆ’ 50 \mu m ^2$ spot size, and the beam repetition rate was 30 Hz. The femto-second pulses were measured using a MPCCD 8-panel detector [ref]. Gain calibrations were provided by SACLA [ref], and dark current measurements were performed every 5000 exposures and used to adjust for electronic noise natural to CCD detectors. With this setup we acquired 200,000 exposures of gold NPs. 

\section{Results}

\section{CXS overview}
Correlated x-ray scattering (CXS) is an emerging technique that aims to extract structural information from solution scattering measurements. We define a solution as a set of identical, non-interacting objects $m$, each with an independent orientation $\omega$ relative to the x-ray beam axis, governed by the objects diffusion constant. We consider $m$ as a collection of $N_a$ atoms each with position vector 
\be
\bm r^m_j (t) = \bm R^m_\omega (t)\cdot \bm r_j + \bm T^m(t) \qquad 1 \le j \le N_a
\ee 
where $\bm R^m_\omega(t)$ is a rotation operator, $\bm T^m (t)$ is a translation operator representing the center of mass position of $m$ at time $t$, and $\bm r_j$ is the position of the $j^{th}$ atom at an arbitrarily defined initial orientation. If we were to freeze the solution at an instant in time and expose it to x-ray photons of wavelength $\lambda$, then we could measure the scattering function

\be
S(\bm q, t) = \left | \sum_m \sum_{j}^{N_a} f_j(q) \,e ^ { -i \,\bm q \cdot \bm  r^m _j (t)  } \right |^2
\ee

Here $f_j( q  )$ is the atomic form factor of the $j^{th}$ atom$, \bm q$ represents a position in reciprocal space (e.g. of a pixel) at scattering angle  

\be \label{angle}
\sin(\theta) = \frac{ \lambda }{ 4 \pi}\,q
\ee

and the outer sum is over all exposed $m$. In general, $S(\bm q, t)$ may be written as

\be \label{ sums }
S( \bm q, t) = \sum_m \left | A^m_\omega (\bm q ) \right|^2 + \sum _{ m \neq m' } A^m_\omega (\bm q) \left (A^{m'}_\omega (\bm q) \right )^*
\ee

where 

\be
A^m_\omega (\bm q) = \sum_{j}^{N_a} f_j(q) e^{ -i \,\bm q \cdot \bm  r^m_j (t)  }
\ee

The strength of the interference term on the RHS of (\ref{ sums }) depends on both the concentration of the sample, and the magnitude of the scattering angle (\ref{angle}). In what follows we will work at relatively high scattering angles, hence we can safely neglect this limit such that we have

\beq \label{ scatter}
S( \bm q, t) &=& \sum_m \left | A^m_\omega (\bm q) \right|^2 \\
&=& \sum_m \left | \sum_{j}^{N_a} f_j(q)\, e^ { -i \,\bm q \cdot \bm  r^m _j (t)} \right | ^2   \\
&=& \sum_m \left | \sum_{j}^{N_a} f_j(q)\, e^ { -i \,\bm q \cdot \left (\bm {R}^m_\omega \left(t\right)\cdot \bm r_j \,+\, \bm {T}^m\left(t\right) \right)} \right | ^2 \\
&=& \sum_m \left | \sum_{j}^{N_a} f_j(q)\, e^ { -i \,\bm q \cdot \bm {R}^m_\omega (t)\cdot \bm r_j }  \right | ^2 
\eeq

After exposing the solution for a finite time interval $\tau$, a pixel at $\bm q$ will record 

\be
n_s( \bm q ) \propto \int_{\tau} S( \bm q, t ) dt
\ee

photons, where $s$ is used to denote a unique exposure, referred to as a Ã”Ã¸Î©shotÃ”Ã¸Î©. For sufficiently long $\tau$, the number of photons scattered from objects in each orientation $\omega$ becomes a constant and $n_s(\bm q)$ approaches a well defined average value
%\be
%\int_{\tau} dt \sum_m  \xrightarrow{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{N_m}{8\pi^2}\int d\omega
%\ee
%and we have
\be 
\bar n(q) \propto \int \left | A_\omega (\bm q) \right | ^2 d\omega
\ee

However, provided $\tau$ is much shorter than the characteristic diffusion time, one can measure a finite fluctuation of the scattering

\be \label{delta_s}
\delta n_s(\bm q) = n_s (\bm q) - \bar n (q )
\ee

By recording many exposure, each representing a different state of the solution frozen in time, one can construct a correlation function

\be \label{delta_cor}
C( \bm q_1, \bm q_2 ) = \sum_s^{N_s} \delta n_s( \bm q_1 )\, \delta n_s( \bm q_2 ) = \sum_s^{N_s} n_s( \bm q_1) n_s (\bm q_2 )  - \bar n( q_1) \bar n(q_2)
\ee

which contains detailed information beyond that contained in the isotropic $\bar n( q)$. To understand the information content stored in (\ref{delta_cor}), one must again consider the solution frozen in time (if $\tau$ is sufficiently small then this is a valid approximation). When the flux is such that each object scatters roughly one photon into a random direction (owing to the objects random orientation) then $C \rightarrow 0$. However, if the x-ray source is bright enough, then an object can scatter photons into at least two directions, $\bm q_1$ and $\bm q_2$. While the orientation of this object is random, the angle 

\be
\cos (\psi) = \frac{\bm q_1 \cdot \bm q_2}{q_1 \, q_2 } 
\ee

is not; it is constrained by the objects internal atomic structure. The overall shape of (\ref{delta_corr}) will rise and fall depending on the local electronic density of the scatterers.  In practice, one probes a small region of reciprocal space during each exposure, namely the pixels on an area detector.

The establishment of protocols for successfully measuring and extracting CXS signal from solution measurements has potential to revolutionize atomic imaging disciplines. It has been shown that super-resolution can be achieved using iterative algorithms which refine low-resolution models using detailed x-ray data [refs] and CXS data are extremely detailed owing to the three-dimensional parameter space. 

The signal-to-noise ratio for (\ref{corr}) increases with each additional recorded exposure, and was proven to be independent of the number of particles in the exposed sample volume [refs]. If one can accurately separate CXS from artificial correlations in the experiment, then in principle measuring CXS of weak scatterers such as proteins in solution should be possible; one need only record enough exposures. With state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (xFEL) facilities one can scatter enough photons per protein in order to make such an experiment feasible [refs]. \emph{(include numbers here on protein scattering cross sections and xFEL focus/flux, showing that one can achieve, say 2+ photons per protein per exposure on average. Perhaps we can use our LCLS data to show this?)}

Currently, the main inhibitions to accurate CXS measurement are fluctuations in the measured intensity not due to the particles under investigation. These arise as artifacts associated with the experiment, including non-uniform pixel response, non-uniform particle distribution in the solution, and background (solvent) scattering [refs]. All of these can lead to artificial intensity correlations. In order to build a foundation for doing CXS on solutions, and to establish methods for overcoming the associated challenges, we have been conducting CXS experiments involving nanoparticles (NPs) in solution. NPs generally have high scattering cross section, making them an good test candidate.

Previously, we reported on extracting CXS from silver NP solution at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). There we made use of a non-linear binary filter and were able to accurately extract CXS from the data which was plagued with artificial correlations. Here we report on substantial advances in our analysis framework, which have allowed us to circumvent the binary filtering step and further resolve additional correlations than those expected from elementary bulk face-centered-cubic (FCC) models of silver NPs. A second experiment involving gold NPs at the xFEL in Japan  confirmed these results, and we have determined that the additional correlations arise due to a very simple NP twinning model [refs]. As CXS from solutions reveals information on the average particle in solution, this implies that the twinning model is common to most FCC NPs in our experiments. By analyzing the magnitude of (\ref{corr}) we estimate the percentage of each individual in the twins.

With these results we demonstrate how CXS can extract additional structural motifs not readily apparent with conventional solution scattering methods.

{\bf Figure captions}

Figure 1: 
Experimental setup: a kapton capillary filled with a solution of silver NPs (face-centered-cubic). Bragg rings $q_{111}$ and $q_{200}$ are illustrated by circles on the detector plane. At least one of the exposed NPs happens to be oriented such that two reciprocal lattice (body-centered-cubic) peaks are intersecting the detector at $q_{111}$. Dashed lines represent the scattering vectors (separated by the angle $\psi$), and solid lines represent the projection of those vectors onto the detector plane (separated by the angle $\Delta$). Artwork courtesy of Gregory M.~Stewart (SLAC).

Figure 2:
{\bf a)} Representative measurement of one x-ray snapshot, $n_{s}( q_{111},\phi)$, \textit{i.e.}~the photon counts around the Bragg ring at $q_{111}$. The horizontal bars show the binary cutoff along the ring for each module. Here, the $q_{111}$ ring spans 10 modules in total. {\bf b)} Histogram of the intensities in {\bf a} on a log scale of photon numbers. Notice the tail at higher intensities, indicating the presence of large particles. {\bf c)} Result of applying the binary filter to {\bf a}. On average, a binary shot at $q_{111}$ is 10\% ones, 77\% zeros and 13\% masked pixels (masked pixels are ignored in the analysis).  {\bf d)} The average binary intensity from a scan of 500 snapshots. Notice systematic structure in the intensity response, indicating intra-module pixel variations. {\bf e)} Typical snapshot showing the Bragg rings at $q_{111}$ and $q_{200}$. Low/high intensities shown in white/black.

Figure 3:
{\bf a)} From top to bottom, measured correlation functions $D (q_{111},q_{200}, \Delta  )$, $D (q_{111},q_{111}, \Delta  )$, and $D (q_{200},q_{200}, \Delta  )$ from 20 nm silver nanoparticles. We truncated the angular range to highlight the correlation peaks. Regions not shown contain artifacts similar to those on the figure, with nothing greater in magnitude than the CXS peaks. {\bf b)} Corresponding simulations of the correlations plotted in {\bf a}. Vertical lines mark analytical predictions. {\bf c)} Simulation (dashed line) and measurement (diamond marker) of a correlation peak width. The simulation was for 20 nm particles. Peak width scales inversely with particle size, hence we expect the measured CXS resulted from particles larger than 20 nm. Shading represents 95\% confidence intervals ($\pm$ 1.96 $\times $ standard error) on the measurement.

Figure 4:
Shows the shot-to-shot variance in the correlation function (\ref{angular_shot}). Large variance is due to the presence of large particles. We illustrate the effectiveness of the binary filter at removing systematic error induced correlations, even when the large particle fluctuations are minimized. {\bf Left)} Histogram of $D_s(q_{111}, q_{111}, \Delta = \Delta_1)$ over all shots on a log scale (raw data without any filter). Outliers were observed with values up to order 1e8, and were removed (not shown). The large tails indicate the presence of large crystals in the data which can contribute to correlations. Red dashed lines mark $\pm$ 200k counts$^2$. {\bf Right)} Plots of $D(q_{111}, q_{111}, \Delta)$ for filtered and unfiltered data. The average was taken over the 4208 shots where both of the following criterion were met: $-200k $ counts$^2 \le D_s(q_{111}, q_{111}, \Delta = \Delta_1) \le 200k$ counts$^2$ ; $-200k $ counts$^2 \le D_s(q_{111}, q_{111}, \Delta = \Delta_2) \le 200k$ counts$^2$. In the unfiltered plot, artificial correlations due to detector and sample anisotropies are similar in magnitude to the true correlation signal. The vertical blue lines mark the analytical prediction of CXS signal ($\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$).
